# My-projects
1) Implemented **String** class for working with strings. With depreciated running time O(1) on push_back, pop_back operations and linear memory usage.
2) The **BigInteger and Rational** class for working with long integers and rational numbers with high precision. The fast multiplication of long integers in O(nlogn) using **FFT** (fast Fourier transform) is implemented
3) The **Geometry** class, which demonstrates how **Inheritance** and **Virtual functions** work in C++
4) The **Residue** class, which implements the ring of subtractions modulo N. By the example of this class we show how to work with templates in C++: In Compile-time it checks the module for simplicity, for the existence of the first-order root
5) The **Matrix** class for working with matrices over arbitrary fields. Implemented multiplication and all operations on matrices except for the determinant for square matrices. This class demonstrates how to work with templates in C++
6) Implemented template class **Deque**, an analogue of the STL class with amortized running time O(1). The internal type iterator is also implemented. Push and pop operations **does not disable iterators** on elements.
