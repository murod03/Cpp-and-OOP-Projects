# My-projects
1) Implemented **String** class for working with strings. With depreciated running time O(1) on push_back, pop_back operations and linear memory usage.
2) The **BigInteger and Rational** class for working with long integers and rational numbers with high precision. The fast multiplication of long integers in O(nlogn) using **FFT** (fast Fourier transform) is implemented.
